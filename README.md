Place to put Automator Actions and AppleScripts

* **Drag Image on Me to Create iOS iconset.app** -- a utility for creating icons to use in an iOS project. Make sure your original image dimensions are square (e.g. 1024x1024) and then drag the image onto this app. The Automator application will create a folder called 'NewIcon.iconset' on your desktop that contains all of the sizes needed for an iOS app. In your Xcode project, you can drag each of these images into their appropriate location inside the AppIcon in Assets.xcassets asset catalog. For good icon design, please refer to https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/ . This script was inspired by Ben Waldie's article at https://www.engadget.com/2012/12/31/preparing-high-res-icon-files-with-automator/
